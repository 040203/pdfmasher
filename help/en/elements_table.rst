Elements Table
==============

This table shows all text elements in the PDF you're currently working on. You can click on any 
column to sort the table by this column. PdfMasher is intended to be used in a "sort and flag" way,
so don't hesitate to abuse this feature. You sort the table in a way that will group the elements
you want to target together, and then you shift select them and flag them (with the buttons in the
Edit pane). These are the columns and their meaning:

* ID: A unique number assigned to each elements extracted from the PDF in the order it was created.
* Page: The page number in which the element is in.
* X: The X position of the leftmost part of the element in the page. The higher the number, the more 
  the element is to the right.
* Y: The Y position of the topmost part of the element in the page. The higher the number, the 
  higher is the element.
* Font size: The average font size of each letter in the element.
* State: Current state of the element (normal, title, footnote, ignored).
* Text: The text of the element.
