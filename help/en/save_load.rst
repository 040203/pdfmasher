Save and Load projects
======================

Creating an e-book out of a PDF can be a long task and seomtimes, we don't have enough time to do it
in one shot. In this case, you can use ``Save Project`` in the ``File`` menu to save your work to a
``.masherproj`` file. This file contains all elements that have been loaded from the PDF along with
their current state and order. You can load these elements back with the ``Load Project`` menu item.
