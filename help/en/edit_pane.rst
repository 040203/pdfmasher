Edit Pane
=========

The "Edit" pane at the bottom of the main window lets you alter the currently selected elements. The
4 buttons at the left change the state of the selected elements. This is their meaning:

* Normal: The text will be displayed normally in the result HTML.
* Title: The text will be a title (H1) in the result HTML.
* Footnote: The text will be moved at the bottom of the document, and an attempt will be made to 
  create an hyperlink to it in the text.
* Ignored: The text will not appear in the result HTML.

The first thing you usually want to do is to flag your "Ignored" elements, and then go on with 
footnotes and titles. Often, ignored elements can get in your way. This is why there's a "Hide 
ignored elements". When it's enabled, ignored elements will disappear from the table.

You can also manually tweak the text of elements. For this, you'll need to select only one element.
Then, change the text and press "Save".
