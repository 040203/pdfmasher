Build Pane
==========

There's not much to do here except click the "View HTML" button (more will be on this pane later).
Clicking this button will create an html file with the same name as the source pdf (except with a
".htm" extension) and open it in your default browser.

Once you're satisfied with the results, you can use an external tool, such as Calibre, to convert
the html to .mobi or .epub. I plan to eventually support direct mobi/epub conversion, but it ain't 
for now.
